# Is PHP Dead? 

No. PHP is obviously not dead. However this is a source of confusion for many people. As dilligent citizens, we decided to build some highly innovative and sophisticated tools to help. 

## isphpdead.io

Web interface to make your chortle and giggle with delight

## API

Ingest this most precious of data sets on the following endpoints...

[https://api.isphpdead.io/status](https://api.isphpdead.io/status)
[https://api.isphpdead.io/loading-message](https://api.isphpdead.io/loading-message)

Each endpoint returns a random answer, based upon the JSON files in this repo. 

## HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE?!? 

HARK! Hear the battle cry. 

Please submit answers, and loading mesages (to be displayed when searching for the answers).

Or better still, use the data to build a fun tool.
